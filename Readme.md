<h2>Cancer Prediction Using Clustering Algorithm with Elbow and Silhouette method</h2>

<p>This project uses a clustering algorithm to analyse cancer. The number of clusters, K, is discovered using Elbow and Silhouette techniques in this K-Means procedure, with the leuanalysisNew1.csv dataset having data fewer than 30. This K-mean clustering approach, perhaps, can provide improved insights into cancer prediction.</p>


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>


<p>As a pre-requisite we need python, jupyter notebook for coding and git hub to host this project. </br>

This project requires the dataset named leuanalysisNew1.csv </p>



<h2>Installing</h2>

<p>Following python libraries was imported before starting the project.<p>

<Li>Pandas</li>

<Li>numpy</li>

<Li>matplotlib</li>

<p>sklearn is also used</p>



<h2>Running the tests</h2>

<p>Dataset was loaded initially and then scaled. Optimum number of clusters was identified using Elbow and Silhouette methods. Silhouette method could be executed more than 1 time to get better Silhouette co-efficients

</br>

Using K-means ploting we plotted dataset with 5 clusters and 2 clusters to get more idea about the datapoints.
